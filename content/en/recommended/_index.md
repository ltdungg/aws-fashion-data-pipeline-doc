## Introduction
In this section, we will build a product recommendation system based on data that has been transformed and stored in the S3 bucket `fashion-clean-zone`. This system will use Amazon DynamoDB to store product recommendations for users[1].

The system works by analyzing user data in near real-time: whenever a user interacts with a product (such as viewing or adding to cart), the system records the interaction and generates recommendations for related products.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create a DynamoDB Table to store product recommendations for users.
2. Create an Amazon ECR repository to store the Docker image for the Lambda Function.
3. Create a Lambda Function to process events from the S3 bucket `fashion-clean-zone` and update product recommendations in DynamoDB.
4. Test the product recommendation system to ensure it works as expected.
